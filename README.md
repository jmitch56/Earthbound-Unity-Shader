# Earthbound-Unity-Shader
A simple re-creation of the Earthbound background effect in Unity using shaders. To use, simpliy add the shader to a material and give 
_MainTex a grayscale gradient pattern (you can find them here: https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/grayscale), and give _RampTex a color ramp. Combine different values with differnet gradient patterns and ramps to create a variety of effects.
